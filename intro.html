            You and friends are an adventurous group and decide to explore a haunted hotel. You guys arrived at the
            hotel and made your way in. Not long after, you strolled astray from your friends to what seemed to be a
            vacant hotel room.<br><br> You entered the room and as you made your way forward, it got darker and colder.
            The
            creaking of the wooden floor and the sound of strong winds roaring through the room sent a chill down your
            spine.<br><br> "BANG!" You turn around to see the door shut on its own. Gasping, you scurried over to the
            door and
            started rattling the door handle, but to no avail. A wave of fear crippled over you and you stood in cold
            sweat as regrets started to flow into you.<br><br> You thought you were brave enough to conquer this creepy
            hotel
            but it didn‚Äôt seem to be.<br><br>
            The sun is setting, you need to find a way out of the hotel room... be as quick as possible!
